8-3 Journal: Portfolio Submission

Software design is a very orderly and iterative process. The recent project was set to cover the object-oriented program design module and the concepts of modular 
design. This has equipped me with the ability to break down very intricate problems into manageable components that make up the whole system, something which is very 
easy to comprehend and maintain. I have used a design process involving initial conceptualization, detailed design using UML diagrams, prototyping, and iterative refinement 
upon receipt of user feedback. The project gave me new design skills, such as advanced 3D modeling techniques and shader programming-skills relevant to the creation of 
realistic visual effects.

While developing the 3D scene, I had been making use of new strategies such as event-driven programming to handle user interactions or using efficient data structures which 
optimize the performance. Iteration was a very important aspect of my development process, whereby every cycle of coding, testing, and refinement improved the scene with each 
iteration both functionally and visually. My attitude and approach to code development themselves changed in the process through the milestones from somewhat ad hoc at the 
beginning to disciplined and methodical, making sure the code was of high quality and maintainable. More importantly, computer science teaches the skills applicable in 
everyday problems, especially in computational graphics and visualizations, thus making this a very important skill both in educational and professional paths. In addition, 
this new skill will enable me to create visualizations for data analysis, simulations, among others, with the ability to increasingly become capable of developing 
sophisticated software solutions.
